        Hi, I'm Madhav Sreejith, a 3rd-year Computer Science student passionate about
        technology and problem-solving. I enjoy learning new concepts, building
        projects, and exploring how software can make life easier and more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently focusing on improving my skills in web development (ReactJS,
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and also exploring data structures, algorithms,
        and core computer science concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from coding, I like reading books and playing games .
        I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate on interesting projects.
